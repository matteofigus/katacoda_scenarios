# Converting JSON to YAML

For years, CloudFormation only supported JSON. We released YAML support and customers wanted a way to convert their existing templates.

AWS CloudFormation Template Flip is a tool that converts [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates between [JSON](http://json.org/) and [YAML](http://yaml.org) formats, making use of the YAML format's short function syntax where possible.

The term "Flip" is inspired by the well-known Unix command-line tool [flip](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~craig/utility/flip/) which converts text files between Unix, Mac, and MS-DOS formats.

## Install 

AWS CloudFormation Template Flip can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

`pip install cfn_flip`{{execute}}
